## Description

Turn a simple Markdown document into an elegant resume with both a perfect
pdf printable format, and a responsive css3 html5 file. You can view a sample
at the [blog post for the project][blog].

## Features

* Three styles to choose from: modern, blockish, unstyled
* PDF generation via `wkhtmltopdf`
* Responsive design for multiple device viewport sizes
* Simple Markdown formatting
* Single file deployment
* You can now version control and branch your resume.

## Quickstart

    php ./bin/resume.php --source resume/sample.md
    php ./bin/resume.php --source resume/sample.md --pdf

## Options

Choose a template with the -t option.

    php ./bin/resume.php --source resume/sample.md -t blockish

If you want to edit your markdown resume in your editor while watching it
update in your browser, run this command:

    watch php ./bin/resume.php -s resume/sample.md -r
    
This makes the build script run periodically, and html document will refresh
every two seconds via a meta tag. Open the `./ouput/sample.html` file in
your browser, and then just save your markdown document when you want to see
a fresh preview.

## Development

Markdown is limited to basic html markup. Follow the `resume/sample.md` file 
as a guideline. This file includes various headers and several nested elements.
This allows us to construct a semantic HTML document for the resume, and then
use a CSS rules to display a very nice resume. Note that because we have very
few ways to nest or identify elements that many of the css rules are based
on descendant and adjacent selectors. 

## TODO

* Google Analytics include

## Acknowledgments

The initial inspiration is from the [Sample Resume Template][srt].
However, no HTML from that project has been used in this. General layout has been reused, and media queries
have been added. It's a nice template, and if you are a more comfortable with html than markdown, you should use it.
