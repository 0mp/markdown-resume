## Examples

Choose a template with the -t option.

    php ./bin/resume.php --source resume/sample.md -t blockish

If you want to edit your markdown resume in your editor while watching it
update in your browser, run this command:

    watch php ./bin/resume.php -s resume/sample.md -r
    
This makes the build script run periodically, and html document will refresh
every two seconds via a meta tag. Open the `./ouput/sample.html` file in
your browser, and then just save your markdown document when you want to see
a fresh preview.

## Development

Markdown is limited to basic html markup. Follow the `resume/sample.md` file 
as a guideline. This file includes various headers and several nested elements.
This allows us to construct a semantic HTML document for the resume, and then
use a CSS rules to display a very nice resume. Note that because we have very
few ways to nest or identify elements that many of the css rules are based
on descendant and adjacent selectors. 

## Development Dependencies

* composer install
* pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
* [install pake][pake]

## TODO

* Google Analytics include

## Acknowledgments

The initial inspiration is from the [Sample Resume Template][srt].
However, no HTML from that project has been used in this. General layout has been reused, and media queries
have been added. It's a nice template, and if you are a more comfortable with html than markdown, you should use it.
